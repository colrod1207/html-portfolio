<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>
    Hereditary
</h3>
<p>
    This horror film is quite impressive 
    because it's not like other horror movies
    This one plays with your head, it plays with silence, a concept 
    not very used and welcomed in industry. I like it because it really 
    scares me and because it's different.

<h3>
    Interestellar
</h3>
<p>
    Talks about space, time-space gap, black holes, relativity, love.
    I think it has all the elements that I love to be worth it.

<h3>
    Dunkerke
</h3>
<p>
    Talks about war, the second world war to be specific.
